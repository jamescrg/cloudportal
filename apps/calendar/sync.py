"""Calendar sync orchestration.

Keeps the inline push-on-save working, while making the whole thing
eventually-consistent: `reconcile()` re-pushes anything that still needs it.
"Needs pushing" is derived purely from the data — google_synced_at IS NULL
(never pushed) or updated_at > google_synced_at (edited since the last push)
— so a failed push needs no special flag: it just leaves google_synced_at
behind and the next reconcile retries it. This one comparison also covers
the first-ever connect (every event has a NULL google_synced_at, so
connecting adopts them all).
